MVP for a react product 

### Why I built this
I personally enjoy getting some work done at coffee shops. I often struggle to find the best coffee shop to work at for different reasons.
I built this MVP to allow people in a similar situation to share their expirience and rate how convinient was their work session at a certain coffee shop.
Now when I want to find a places I go see if where I want to go has the necesssities. Such as (wifi, charging socket, how crowded is the place).
I'm excited to test this MVP with users.
